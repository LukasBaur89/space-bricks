SpaceBricks



## Description
SpaceBricks is a recreated browser game, originated from the most popular arcarde game Arnaknoid which was first built and published by Taito in 1986. The idea of my game is to have one player who has to destroy bricks using a ball and preventing it from falling off the playing field. After reaching a score of 1000 points, the amount of balls increases difficulty. The player wins the game when all bricks are destroyed. After that, a score is calculated based on the bricks the player destroyed. The player looses the game if he misses to catch the ball with the platform. 


## MVP

- The game has a moving platform, a ball and 10 rows of colored bricks
- the player uses the left and right arrow keys to move the platform
- each brick gives a different amount of points
- the ball moves down horizontally from the center towards the platform and jumps up when the player catches it
- the ball destroys bricks on top of the screen
- scoreboard on top right of the screen
- score increases when a brick is destroyed
- increasing difficulty when reaching 1000 points, ball speed and ball amount increases
- player has three lives in form of a heart being displayed on the top left screen
- player looses one live out of three when the ball falls off the playing field
- option to turn on and turn off game sound when clicking on a button
- (including more interactions)



## Backlog
